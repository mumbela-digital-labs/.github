# 🌍 Mumbela Digital Labs

Welcome to **Mumbela Digital Labs** — an innovation-driven software organization focused on building **scalable, maintainable, and human-centered digital solutions**.  
We specialize in **Rails ViewComponent architecture**, **style abstraction**, and **learning platform components** that empower developers and learners alike.

## 🚀 Mission
To design and deliver **robust, reusable, and style-agnostic components** that accelerate digital learning platforms and enterprise applications.  
We believe in **clarity, scalability, and developer empowerment** through thoughtful architecture.

## 🛠️ What We Build
Our work centers on:
- **Reusable UI Components**: Cards, tables, alerts, badges, progress bars, tabs, accordions, tooltips, modals, navigation, and more.
- **Style Abstraction & Inheritance**: Centralized section logic with framework interoperability (Bootstrap for admin, Tailwind for frontend).
- **Preview-Driven Development**: Isolated component previews for rapid iteration and onboarding.
- **Scalable Folder Structures**: Architectures that maximize clarity and maintainability across projects.
